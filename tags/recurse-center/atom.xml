		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Recurse Center&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is this magical place where hours fly by, and you can be as distracted or as focused as you choose to be. It&#x27;s composed of two nice floors of a building in downtown Brooklyn. They provide a space where you can progress on your own programming specific goals at your own self direction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my best friends are RCers. All of them really enjoyed their time at RC, and would recommend it to anyone who would listen. With glowing praise from people I deeply respect, how could I not give it a try? It also helped that I had a friend and former co-worker (Fred) applying for a week long batch as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I was skeptical about it. It also seemed like quite a bit of work. I spent days on their &amp;quot;What do you want to be doing in 2 years question&amp;quot;; I&#x27;d have to do two interviews; and I&#x27;d have to figure out living logistics. Given those hurdles I was skeptical of what the benefit of the program would be. Despite my skepticism I decided to trust my friends. Well... Truthfully Fred nudged me along, and I&#x27;m very glad he did.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-mini-batch-1-week-long-program&quot;&gt;The Mini Batch. (1 Week long program)&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mini batch seems like a strategy to bring in folks who cannot be in NYC for 6 or 12 weeks or are not ready for that level of commitment (That&#x27;s me!). It felt much shorter than I was expecting (and I was expecting it to be short). Every day of the week puts you 20% closer to the end of the program! After seeing how fast a week goes by, 6 and 12 weeks don&#x27;t seem so long.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-s-special-about-the-recurse-center&quot;&gt;What&#x27;s special about The Recurse Center&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project I worked on is something I&#x27;ve been toying with in my mind for a while. I even wrote a couple toy implementations that never got fleshed out. I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea for at least 4 months, and hadn&#x27;t made much progress. After a week at RC, however, starting from scratch, I&#x27;d already gotten much farther than ever before. I believe it was a combination of a couple things at RC.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can spend your time programming on your own projects (and people will think that&#x27;s neat)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrast this with most places where the external pressures ask:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At home: &amp;quot;What are you doing that for? Is it for work? Oh, It isn&#x27;t? Okay.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Vacation: &amp;quot;Why are you on your computer when you could be outside exploring?&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hackathon: &amp;quot;What are you working on? How is going to make us two boat loads of money?&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A social space &lt;em&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; quiet space.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Recurse Center has two floors. A quiet floor (imagine a less strict library) and an active&#x2F;social floor (where people talk freely, express freely, and openly invite each other to pair program something with them.). I think this is really important and, thinking back to previous jobs, I think it would be a great addition to any company with enough programmers. Sometimes I want to talk to people, and be interrupted, and pair with someone; but sometimes I just want to sit down, uninterrupted, and get lost in my problem space and thoughts.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversity.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The diversity in the people who attend.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being at RC lets me preview a world where our industry is more inclusive and diverse.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with different backgrounds bring different thoughts and potential solutions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A monoculture of ideas is a recipe for stagnation. Team work &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?smid=pl-share&quot;&gt;objectively&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; leads to better solutions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The diversity in the knowledge backgrounds.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick example: Imagine you want to know how VGA character buffers work, you can find someone who spent at least a week studying it in a matter of minutes.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get pleasantly side-tracked with someone else&#x27;s rabbit hole.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can explore the limits of your knowledge when explaining things you thought you understood to people who are genuinely curious!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a startup incubator
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used to go to hackathons because I liked the idea of building something fun with friends. I stopped going because it turned into a competition to see which one of these 48 hour projects can become the next unicorn startup. (Incidentally, Brian and I started our own hackathon we call the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptic.house&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dumbathon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which tries to find the original spirit of the hackathon.)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At RC, no one ever asks &amp;quot;How are you going to make money off this?&amp;quot; If all you end up after your batch is a deeper understanding of problems that interest you, then you&#x27;ve had a successful time there and no one will tell you differently.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightweight Social Rules.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interacting with a lot of new people is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. RC has 4 &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;social-rules&quot;&gt;lightweight social rules&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to help people be nice to each other. On top of that, there&#x27;s an understanding that everyone here is clever and everyone is here because they truly want to be here. That level of commitment isn&#x27;t common in most interactions. The combination of those two things make it a joy to interact with other RCers in the space and get lost talking about your programming project or hearing about their recent problems.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-i-think-you-should-do-it&quot;&gt;Why I think you should do it&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem selfish or purely indulgent to take away time from your life to go to a programmer&#x27;s retreat, it isn&#x27;t. Take history&#x27;s most selfless person, The Buddha. He dedicated his life to reducing the suffering of those around him. One lesser know story about The Buddha is that he would have &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vassa&quot;&gt;3 month retreats&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; yearly where he and his disciples could refocus and reinvest their energies. I tell this anecdote not to liken us to The Buddha, but to point out that the prototypical selfless person found these retreats useful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in the daily grind it&#x27;s easy to loose sight of the things that matter to you. Often when at a normal job, your goals of growth and learning don&#x27;t align with the bottom line of the business. That&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s very nice to be able to step back and re-hone your tool set.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-project&quot;&gt;My Project&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a week, I built an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MarcoPolo&#x2F;android-wired&quot;&gt;Android UI Library for Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I am proud of it, and I&#x27;ll have another post that details it at length.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
