# Introduction

There are 3 parts that let JS talk to Go:

1. The C++ binding
2. Installing the binding
3. Calling Go

Not all the code is shown, check out the [source code](https://github.com/MarcoPolo/react-native-hostobject-demo) for specifics.

### Part 1 - The C++ Binding

The binding is the C++ glue code that will hook up your Go code to the JS runtime. The binding itself is composed of two main parts.

#### Part 1.1 - The C++ Binding

The binding is a c++ class that implements the `jsi::HostObject` interface. At the very least it's useful for it to have a `get` method defined. The type of the `get` method is:

```c++
jsi::Value get(jsi::Runtime &runtime, const jsi::PropNameID &name) override;
```

It returns a `jsi::Value` (a value that is safe for JS). It's given the JS runtime and the prop string used by JS when it `get`s the field. e.g. `global.nativeTest.foo` will call this method with PropNameID === `"foo"`.

#### Part 1.2 - The C++ Binding's install

Now that we've defined our HostObject, we need to install it into the runtime. We use a static member function that we'll call later to set this up. It looks like this:

```c++
void TestBinding::install(jsi::Runtime &runtime,
                          std::shared_ptr<TestBinding> testBinding) {
  // What is the name that js will use when it reaches for this?
  // i.e. `global.nativeTest` in JS
  auto testModuleName = "nativeTest";
  // Create a JS object version of our binding
  auto object = jsi::Object::createFromHostObject(runtime, testBinding);
  // set the "nativeTest" propert
  runtime.global().setProperty(runtime, testModuleName, std::move(object));
}
```

### Part 2. Installing the binding (on Android)

Since we have a reference to the runtime in Java land, we'll have to create a JNI method to pass the runtime ptr to the native C++ land. We can add this JNI method to our TestBinding file with a guard.

```c++
#if ANDROID
extern "C" {
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_com_testmodule_MainActivity_install(
    JNIEnv *env, jobject thiz, jlong runtimePtr) {
  auto testBinding = std::make_shared<example::TestBinding>();
  jsi::Runtime *runtime = (jsi::Runtime *)runtimePtr;

  example::TestBinding::install(*runtime, testBinding);
}
}
#endif
```

Then on the Java side (after we compile this into a shared library), we register this native function and call it when we're ready.

```java
// In MainActivity

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity implements ReactInstanceManager.ReactInstanceEventListener {
    static {
        // Load our jni
        System.loadLibrary("test_module_jni");
    }

    //... ellided ...

    @Override
    public void onReactContextInitialized(ReactContext context) {
        // Call our native function with the runtime pointer
        install(context.getJavaScriptContextHolder().get());
    }

    //  declare our native function
    public native void install(long jsContextNativePointer);
}
```

### Part 3. Calling Go

Now that our binding is installed in the runtime, we can make it do something useful.

```c++
jsi::Value TestBinding::get(jsi::Runtime &runtime,
                            const jsi::PropNameID &name) {
  auto methodName = name.utf8(runtime);

  if (methodName == "runTest") {
    return jsi::Function::createFromHostFunction(
        runtime, name, 0,
        [](jsi::Runtime &runtime, const jsi::Value &thisValue,
           const jsi::Value *arguments,
           size_t count) -> jsi::Value { return TestNum(); });
  }
  return jsi::Value::undefined();
}

```

Here we return a `jsi::Function` when JS calls `global.nativeTest.runTest`. When JS calls it (as in `global.nativeTest.runTest()`) we execute the code inside the closure, which just returns `TestNum()`. TestNum is a Go function that's exported through cgo so that it is available to c/c++. Our Go code looks like this:

```go
package main

import "C"

// TestNum returns a test number to be used in JSI
//export TestNum
func TestNum() int {
	return int(9001)
}
func main() {
}
```

cgo builds a header and creates a shared library that is used by our binding.

### Building

- Look at the CMakeLists.txt for specifics on building the C++ code.
- Look at from-go/build.sh for specifics on building the go code.

### A Go Shared Library for C + Java

It's possible to build the Go code as a shared library for both C and Java, but you'll have to define your own JNI methods. It would be nice if gomobile bind also generated C headers for android, but it doesn't seem possible right now. Instead you'll have to run `go build -buildmode=c-shared` directly and define your jni methods yourself. Take a look at `from-go/build.sh` and testnum.go for specifics.
