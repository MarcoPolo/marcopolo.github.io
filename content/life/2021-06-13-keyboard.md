I got around to building this new keyboard. It's essentially the [lightcycle
version](https://twitter.com/adereth/status/852975999905964032) of the [Dactyl
keyboard](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard). The few differences are
that the space and port for the board is bigger to accommodate a
[nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) board with pins.

The keyboard is wireless thanks to the nice!nano. The board has a USB-C
connector, but I added these [magnetic charging and data
cables](https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Charging-CAFELE-Braided-Compatible/dp/B08BLJ62J8)
to make charging and connecting easy and lessen the force on the port on the
board.

I can also sling the keyboard halves with some cord and wear it as a stylish
scarf.
