    <h1 id="no-one-at-the-wheel-driverless-cars-and-the-road-of-the-future">No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars and the road of the Future</h1>
<p>I picked this book up after listening to Schwartz talk on <em>Fresh Air</em>. Schwartz
is a traffic engineer, who worked at the chief traffic engineer for NYC. I was
interested in this book because it adds a healthy dose of skepticism to all the
hype I've heard about self-driving cars. I expected him to say &quot;The future will
be perfect, self driving cars will solve all our problems&quot; or &quot;The future is
terrible, self driving cars will run over all the babies&quot;. Instead, he was in an
informed center. He acknowledges a lot of benefits AVs (autonomous vehicles) can
bring, refutes some hollow claims from advocates, and points out several
pitfalls to avoid.</p>
<p>The book is an easy read and goes by quickly. I mostly listened to it,
amusingly enough, from a drive from Montana to California (where I
wished I had a self driving car to make the drive easier).</p>
<p>Schwartz refutes some ideas about AVs that I thought were a given. First is
that AVs, and AVs alone, will reduce traffic fatalities to nil. It's true that
AVs can introduce technology that will reduce traffic fatalities, but it is also
true that <strong>right now</strong> we have that technology that we can incorporate in non
self driving vehicles. Technologies like front collision warning (reduces accidents
by 7%), automatic front collision braking (reduces accidents by 15%), and lane
detection are available today. These technologies are shown to make driving
safer, but they are only available on high end luxury vehicles. We have the
power today to make the roads vastly safer overnight by passing legislation to
make these safety features standard.</p>
<p>The book warns of a dystopia future where everyone ones their own AV. In this
world traffic is continually clogged and up to half of the cars in traffic are
empty. People drive much more because it is that much easier. They sacrifice the
exercise they would have gained in biking or walking by choosing the easier
option of watching a movie while waiting in deadlock traffic. In this future,
AVs are more like phones. A new model coming out every year or so, and people
upgrading just as often. All the new production would have an obvious adverse
effect on climate. Likewise the increase in traffic would be terrible for the
environment.</p>
<p>The happy future Schwartz talks about is a future where AVs work with traffic
engineers to complement existing transit infrastructure. There could be AV
buses that could run much more frequently on more routes 24/7 that would extend
existing public transit routes. Autonomous mini buses can be used to create a
route on demand for the rush hour commuters to bring them to a bigger transit
hub (e.g. a subway). Smaller AVs can then be used in the off hours to get people
to their nearest transit hub, thus solving the last mile problem.</p>
<p>Schwartz sprinkles his book with parallels from the time cars where first
introduced. Roads where first made for cyclist. Cyclist were lobbying for more
roads around the time cars were being introduced. As cars became more ubiquitous
and faster, bicyclist and pedestrians were kicked off the roads and
criminalized. Roads took over and changed our cities into desolate avenues with
drivers careening through city centers at 40mph. Schwartz argues, and I'm
inclined to agree, we cannot let AVs push everyone else as second class
citizens. We are at an inflection point where we can define legislation to
prioritize pedestrians and city life.</p>
<p>I would recommend <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07B8JGG5M/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&amp;sa-no-redirect=1">this book</a>.</p>
